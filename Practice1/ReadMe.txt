Practice #1 - Creating a classroom

In this practice you will be creating functions to work with a classroom of students. The functions you will be creating are outlined below:

    - Enroll students into your classroom as objects
    - Change information for students
    - Add grades for students
    - Remove lowest grade for students, because you're the cool teacher
    - Report average grade for the year

The parameters and returns of each object are given with each function. You will be editing the classroom.js file and writing the necessary functions to perform the tasks above.

A testing suite is added with the activity to check your progress along the way.

You may need to download node.js on your computer if you do not have it already: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

To run your code from terminal, you may use:    node <scriptname>.js
    - To run your code, use:    node clasroom.js
    - To run the answer, use:   node answer.js

The answer code provided is meant to show you one way to do the project. By no means is it the only way to complete the task at hand.

Good Luck!
